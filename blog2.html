            <p>Project planning and scheduling is both an art and a science. No two project managers or planning professionals develop identical plans or project schedules. The planning process is creative and reflects the plannerâ€™s approach and style. Even
                though the project plan is unique to the approach and style of the planner, methods for developing the schedule and documenting the resulting plan follow certain rules.
            </p>
            <p>
                On larger and more complex projects, a planning function composed of a small team of planning and scheduling experts may be needed to develop and track the project schedule. Project planners facilitate the development of the information required to develop
                the project plan using templates, past or similar projects, and most importantly, the thoughts and plans of the project team leaders and members.

            <h2>project time management includes the following elements</h2>
            <li>Define activities</li>
            <li>Sequence activities</li>
            <li>Estimate activity resources</li>
            <li>Estimate activity durations</li>
            <li>Develop schedule</li>
            <li>Control schedule</li>

            <h2>Managing Schedules Using Milestones</h2>
            <p>Milestones provide the opportunity for project management to focus on completing activities that will have the greatest impact on the schedule. On complex projects, focusing on the milestones is useful for communicating important dates to
                the entire project team. Project team members can then adjust their efforts to complete the activities connected to the milestone events.</p>

            <p>It's really hard decisions about paying overtime and working weekends are often delayed until the end of the project when the pressure to complete the project on time becomes much stronger. Project managers who focus on milestone events create
                a sense of urgency to meet the milestone deadlines and spread the urgency to complete the project over the life of the project. Projects that meet milestone dates are more likely to meet project completion dates.</p>
